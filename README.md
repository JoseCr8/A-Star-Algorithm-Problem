# A Star Algorithm Problem
This is a University project, were we needed to create a search algorithm using the A* search to find the best solution to a problem.

The problem asked to assign a queue of students depending on certain traits (low mobility / good mobility, undisciplined / disciplined), the combination of this traits made the students slower when boarding a school bus. So the algorithm had to find the best solution, meaning the one in which the students took the least time to board the bus. We were also tasked with making heuristics for the algorithm.

The code is writtend in python 3 and has a script to run the program with some tests.
